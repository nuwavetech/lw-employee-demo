## Employee CRUD Sample Client Application

The client application consists of two files:
  * index.html
  * index.js
  
 You should download the files to a folder on your local PC, or install on any web server. Open the index.html file with your browser. Enter the name (or IP address) and service port of your LightWave server. (Check your LightWave Server Console to see the available ports.) The application is hard-coded to use 'http:'. You can change it to 'https:', if you need to, by editing index.html.
